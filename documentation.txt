#login / signup logic : 

two ooptions with google or local 

on google mode : 
1. getting form google email and name 
2. in next auth chacking if user in the database?
     if yes check it's user.password?
            if yes it is means that someone signup with this email localy therfore we return false !
                and in the LogInSignup component we give userMsg = user exsist in database 
   if not user not in database still returning true and the exploerer recives the session.
3. in LogInSignup in UseEffect we check if there is session if yes
        we get with the email in database if we have if not we creact a new user 
        and redirect to '/welcome/${user._id}'   

on locale mode : 
1. getting email name and password from form and check if is this email exsist in the database if yes?
    giving user msg 'user exsist' and return if not 
        creating new user 

**when creaction a new user the isNewUser = true after sucssesful signup 
the useEffect func checks if user is exsist in the database if not 
    it is because signup was via google. if yes ?
        then check isNewUser? if yes 
            redirct to /welcome/userId
                if not
                    redirct to '/'
