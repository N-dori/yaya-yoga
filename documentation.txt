#login / sighup logic : 

two options with google or local 

on google mode : 
1. getting form google email and name 
2. in next auth checking if user in the database?
     if yes check it's user.password?
            if yes it is means that someone sign-up with this email locally therefore we return false !
                and in the LogInSignup component we give userMsg = user exist in database 
   if not user not in database still returning true and the explorer receives the session.
3. in LogInSignup in UseEffect we check if there is session if yes
        we get with the email in database if we have if not we create a new user 
        and redirect to '/welcome/${user._id}'   

on locale mode : 
1. getting email name and password from form and check if is this email exist in the database if yes?
    giving user msg 'user exist' and return if not 
        creating new user 

**when creation a new user the isNewUser = true after successful sign-up
the useEffect func checks if user is exist in the database if not 
    it is because sign-up was via google. if yes ?
        then check isNewUser? if yes 
            redirect to /welcome/userId
                if not
                    redirect to '/'


#/welcome/userId

 1.this page give a welcome massage
 2.toggleNewUser to false at the database
 3. sends an email with a link to fill-out health declaration via
    client cmp <SendEmailOnlyOnce user={user}/>
